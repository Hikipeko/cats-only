# Cats Only Website

## Overview
Welcome to [Cats Only](hikipeko.info), a web application where users can share and explore images of adorable cats! This project was developed based on EECS 485 course at the University of Michigan. The website is built with a focus on user interaction, allowing users to post, like, and comment on cat images, all while enjoying a seamless and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used
* Backend:
  * Python (Flask): For creating a REST API that handles requests and serves data to the frontend.
  * SQL (SQLite): For managing and storing user data, posts, and comments.
* Frontend:
  * React.js: For building dynamic client-side pages that run in the browser.
  * Bootstrap: For responsive and modern design elements.
  * HTML5 & CSS3: For structuring and styling the web pages.
* Deployment:
  * AWS EC2: For hosting and deploying the application on a cloud server.

The application is built using client-side dynamic pages powered by React.js, which interacts with a REST API developed using Flask. The frontend makes AJAX calls to the REST API to fetch and update data asynchronously, providing a smooth user experience.
